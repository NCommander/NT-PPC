 This file contains the message definitions for the Win32
 cliptext.exe sample program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 HEADER SECTION

 The header section defines names and language identifiers for use
 by the message definitions later in this file. The MessageIdTypedef,
 SeverityNames, FacilityNames, and LanguageNames keywords are
 optional and not required.



 The LanguageNames keyword defines the set of names that are allowed
 as the value of the Language keyword in the message definition. The
 set is delimited by left and right parentheses. Associated with each
 language name is a number and a file name that are used to name the
 generated resource file that contains the messages for that
 language. The number corresponds to the language identifier to use
 in the resource table. The number is separated from the file name
 with a colon. The initial value of LanguageNames is:

LanguageNames=(English=1:MSG00001)

 Any new names in the source file which don't override the built-in
 names are added to the list of valid languages. This allows an
 application to support private languages with descriptive names.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MESSAGE DEFINITION SECTION

 Following the header section is the body of the Message Compiler
 source file. The body consists of zero or more message definitions.
 Each message definition begins with one or more of the following
 statements:

 MessageId = [number|+number]
 Severity = severity_name
 Facility = facility_name
 SymbolicName = name

 The MessageId statement marks the beginning of the message
 definition. A MessageID statement is required for each message,
 although the value is optional. If no value is specified, the value
 used is the previous value for the facility plus one. If the value
 is specified as +number then the value used is the previous value
 for the facility, plus the number after the plus sign. Otherwise, if
 a numeric value is given, that value is used. Any MessageId value
 that does not fit in 16 bits is an error.

 The Severity and Facility statements are optional. These statements
 specify additional bits to OR into the final 32-bit message code. If
 not specified they default to the value last specified for a message
 definition. The initial values prior to processing the first message
 definition are:

 Severity=Success
 Facility=Application

 The value associated with Severity and Facility must match one of
 the names given in the FacilityNames and SeverityNames statements in
 the header section. The SymbolicName statement allows you to
 associate a C/C++ symbolic constant with the final 32-bit message
 code.
