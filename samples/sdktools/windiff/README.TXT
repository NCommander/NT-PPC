A Graphical Difference Program


SUMMARY
=======

The WINDIFF tool takes two files, or two directories, and does a 
byte-for-byte file comparison. It then displays the results in a scrollable 
window, lining up the identical parts, and marking with color the parts of 
the files that differ. This application can be useful for doing source level 
management of code. 

This multithread tool allows you to interact with the window while the file 
comparisons occur in the background.
