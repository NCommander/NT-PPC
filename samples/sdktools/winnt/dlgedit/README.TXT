Dialog Editor


The DlgEdit tool allows you to design and test a dialog box on a display 
screen instead of defining dialog box statements in a resource script. You
can use DlgEdit to create new dialog boxes and to add or remove controls 
from an existing dialog box. You can then compile this resource file
using the resource compiler. The binary output from the resource
compiler can then be linked into your application's executable file.

DlgEdit demonstrates the following techniques:

1. Creating dialog boxes.
2. Reading and writing resource files.
3. Creating control windows.
4. Creating a help file.
5. Creating custom controls.
6. Creating groups of controls.
7. Working with include files.
