Monitoring Messages with SPY


SUMMARY
=======

The SPY tool demonstrates how to monitor system messages sent to a specified
window. SPY records the messages and displays them on the specified device. 
SPY is also useful in debugging, to verify that the messages you think a 
window is receiving are actually being received.

SPY demonstrates the following techniques:

  - Using a system message hook.
  - Using the WM_COPYDATA message to pass data to another application.
  - Reading and writing the registry.
  - Creating a thread.
  - Creating a DLL for the hook.
