IMallocSpy Interface


SUMMARY
=======

The CMALLSPY sample demonstrates a simple implementation of the IMallocSpy 
interface. When the capability for replaceable memory allocators was 
removed from 32-bit OLE, the ability for applications to provide their own 
debug allocators for OLE was also removed. OLE disallows caller-provided 
allocators for multithread safety and general robustness. To provide a way 
for applications to monitor memory allocation, detect memory leaks, and 
simulate memory failure, OLE now provides support for a simple wrapper for 
the IMalloc interface called the IMallocSpy interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See the OLE programmer's documentation for a complete description of the 
IMallocSpy interface and the CoRegisterMallocSpy and CoRevokeMallocSpy 
functions.

You can also find a more complete implementation of IMallocSpy in the 
OLESTD sample library in the MALSPY.C and MALSPY.H files.
