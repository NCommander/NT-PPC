VTable Binding


The HELLCTRL sample is a vtable binding automation controller that controls
the HELLO sample.

HELLCTRL uses CoCreateInstance to create an instance of Hello and obtains 
its IHello interface using QueryInterface. It then calls the methods of the 
IHello interface to access the properties and methods of the Hello object. 
Rich Error Information is obtained by accessing the IErrorInfo interface.

FILES
-----

tlb.h         File copied from the HELLO 2.0 sample. Generated by MKTYPLIB.
hellctrl.cpp  Controller source file.
hellctrl.h    Controller source header.

To compile:
-----------

To compile an ANSI debug version of the sample for Windows NT and Windows 95,
use the following command:

   nmake

To compile a Unicode debug version of the sample for Windows NT only, use the
following command:

   nmake dev=win32 HOST=NT

To compile a 16-bit debug version of the sample and if your development
environment is Win 3.x, use the following command. If your development
environment is Win95 or NT, change the HOST appropriately.

   nmake dev=win16 HOST=DOS

To clean up between builds which use different options, use one of the
following commands:

   nmake clean
   nmake dev=win16 clean

See the makefile header comments for other make options.

If one of the tools cannot find SDKUTIL.LIB, use the SAMPLES\OLE\COMMON sample
to build SDKUTIL.LIB.

Visual C++ 2.x and above can use makefile as an external makefile 
after making the following replacement in the makefile:

   !include <$(MSTOOLS)\samples\ole\include\olesampl.mak>

with

   !include <win32.mak>


To run:
-------

Select the CreateHello menu after registering the HELLO 2.0 sample.
This will launch Hello invisibly. Use the SetVisible menu to make
it visible.
