#  File:       MAKEFILE
#
#  Summary:    Makefile for building all of the Tutorial Code Samples in
#              the COM branch.  It assumes that you have set up your
#              environment to compile Win32 applications using the Win32
#              SDK with Visual C++ v. 2.x+ or later or other compatible
#              32-bit C++ compiler. This makefile assumes that the tutorial
#              code samples reside within the directory structure of an
#              installed Win32 SDK. If you have extracted the COM branch to
#              a location outside the Win32 SDK then use MAKEALL.BAT to
#              compile all the samples in the branch instead of this
#              makefile.
#
#              In general, to set up your system to build and test the
#              Win32 code samples in this OLE Tutorial series, see the
#              global TUTORIAL.TXT file for details.  This MAKEFILE is
#              Microsoft NMAKE compatible and the 'debug' build can be
#              achieved by simply issuing the NMAKE command in a command
#              prompt window.
#
#  Builds:     All Tutorial Code Samples in proper order.
#
#  Origin:     3-20-96: atrent - For incorporation into Win32 SDK.
#
#--Usage:-------------------------------------------------------------------
#  NMAKE Options
#
#  Use the table below to determine the additional options for NMAKE to
#  generate various application debugging, profiling and performance tuning
#  information.
#
#  Application Information Type         Invoke NMAKE
#  ----------------------------         ------------
#  For Debugging Info (default)         nmake -a
#  For No Debugging Info                nmake -a nodebug=1
#  For Working Set Tuner Info           nmake -a tune=1
#  For Call Attributed Profiling Info   nmake -a profile=1
#
#  Note: The three options above are mutually exclusive (you may use only
#        one to compile/link the application).
#
#  Note: creating the environment variables NODEBUG, TUNE, and PROFILE
#        is an alternate method to setting these options via the nmake
#        command line.
#
#  Additional NMAKE Options             Invoke NMAKE
#  ----------------------------         ------------
#  For No ANSI NULL Compliance          nmake -a no_ansi=1
#    (ANSI NULL is defined as PVOID 0)
#  To clean up temporary binaries       nmake clean
#  To clean up all generated files      nmake cleanall
#  To register all servers              nmake regall
#  To unregister all servers            nmake unregall
