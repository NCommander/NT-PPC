A version of Component Cosmo that uses POLY16.DLL is exactly the
same as one build for POLY11.DLL as described in \CHAP11\COCOSMO\README.TXT
since both versions of Polyline use the same CLSID_Polyline11.

Just note how all the in-place activation support in Polyline does
not preclude Component Cosmo from using like a non-compound document
embedded object!
