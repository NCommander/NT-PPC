 *
 *  All Advise Sink methods are asynchronous and therefore we
 *  should attempt no synchronous calls from within them to an EXE
 *  object.  If we do, we'll get RPC_E_CALLREJECTED as shown below.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  pFEIn           LPFORMATETC describing format that changed
 *  pSTM            LPSTGMEDIUM providing the medium in which the
 *                  data is provided.
