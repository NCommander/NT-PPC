Cabview Sample
==============

The CABVIEW samples implements a namespace extension that is presented in
the Explorer's namespace.  It also parses and extracts component files
from CAB files.  The library for working with CAB files is provided for
x86 only.

After the sample DLL has been built, to install the sample:
1. Right Click on the CABVIEW.INF file and select Install from the menu

To run the sample
1. Through the explorer browse to a directory containing a .CAB file such
   as the Windows 95 release CD.
2. You will observe that the icon shown by Explorer for this cab file is
   CABVIEW.ICO, if your Cabview extension has been installed correctly.
3. Double click on the CAB file and a new Explorer window will be launched. 
4. This will show the contents of the CAB file.
5. You can extract a file from the window by double clicking on the file icon.
