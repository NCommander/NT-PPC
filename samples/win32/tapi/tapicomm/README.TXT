Telephony API (TAPI) Sample


The TapiComm sample uses both the Telephony API and the Win32 Communications 
API to demonstrate one way to implement a very simple TTY application. While 
the user interface and TTY emulation are very rudimentary, the TAPI and comm 
modules are fairly complete.

For more information, see the tapicomm.doc or tapicomm.rtf file included in 
the TapiComm sample directory.
