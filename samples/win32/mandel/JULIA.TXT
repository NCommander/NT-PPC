MANDEL

  Summary:

  Mandelbrot Dream is a fractal program.  Specifically, it generates
  the Mandelbrot set and its corresponding Julia sets.  User is able
  to zoom into any set.  The zoom-in picture will be displayed in a
  new MDI child window.

  In addition, the program can trace out the boundary of a mandelbrot
  set and select the complicated boundary scan as a clip region.  This
  feature enables users to create wonderful fractal art with existing
  DIBs and DIB generated by this program.  Moreover, users will be
  able to save and print the art they created.

  Other features include visual effect created by animating the
  palette and shifting of entries of the color table.  Saving picture
  as monochrome bitmap which can be used as mask for maskblt.  Again,
  this feature can be used to generate fractal art.  Also, cut and
  paste into clipboard will be added.


  Logical Design:

  Fractal generation: on separate drawing threads using either
                      floating point or fixed-point math.  Drawing
                      threads will be suspended if users moves windows
                      around and resumed later on.

  Zooming in region: can be transformed including rotation.

  Saving DIB: uses the DIB modules in the DIBSAMP2.ZIP.

  Boundary tracing: Traces out the boundary points as PATH.  The
                    resulting PATH can be selected as clipped region.
                    Then all drawing in the child window will be clipped
                    to the complex region.

  Palette cycling: animate palette
