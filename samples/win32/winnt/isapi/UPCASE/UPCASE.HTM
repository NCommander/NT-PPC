<h1>Internet Server Sample Filter: UpCase</h1>

<b><i>"Where do you want to uppercase today?"</i></b>
<hr>
This sample works by looking for requests for .htm files in a directory path
that ends with /UC. It then strips the trailing /uc from the directory path
and uppercases the body of the HTML text that goes by.  To install it add
the full pathname of the DLL to the following registry value (this value is a
comma separated list).

<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
  SYSTEM\
    CurrentControlSet\
      Services\
        W3SVC\
          Parameters
            Filter DLLs="C:\INetSrv\Scripts\SDK\UpCase.Dll"
</pre><p>
Like any ISAPI Filter, this DLL is loaded when the http server is started
and it stays loaded until
the http server is stopped.  Errors in this DLL can hang the server.  The
http server can be stopped via "net stop w3svc", or you can use the tips in
readme.txt in the SDK to run the http service as an interactive process
for debugging.
