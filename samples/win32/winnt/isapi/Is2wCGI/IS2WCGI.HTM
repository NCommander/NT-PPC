<I>IS2WCGI - Internet Server to Windows CGI 1.2 Conversion Tool</I>
<HR>

<FORM ACTION="http:/Scripts/SDK/is2wcgi.Dll" METHOD="POST">

<P>
This sample implements a useful tool if you have Windows CGI applications.
 The spec is at <A HREF="http://website.ora.com/wsdocs/32demo/windows-cgi.html">website.ora.com</A>.
<P>
The code for IS2WCGI.Dll illustrates how to gather inbound data
in an ISAPI Dll, how to build a profile compliant
with the Windows CGI specification, and how to send the data back
after the Windows CGI process completes.
<P>
If you have built this sample, you can use this form to test it.
 IS2WCGI.EXE is a sample Windows CGI application that simply replies
with the profile it was given.  IS2WCGI.Dll is the server extension
that translates web data to and from IS2WCGI.EXE.
<P>
You can also use IS2WCGI.Dll with other Windows CGI applications
you may have.  Simply rename the IS2WCGI Dll to match your
application, and write an HTML page that calls the Dll for the
submit button.  For example, if you have an app named MyApp.Exe,
rename IS2WCGI.Dll to MyApp.Dll in the same directory as MyApp.Exe.  
Modify the HTML page that accesses
MyApp.Exe so it submits a request to MyApp.Dll.  The Dll will
load your application and translate the output for you.
