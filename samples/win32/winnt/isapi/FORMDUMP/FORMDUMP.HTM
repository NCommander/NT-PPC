<I>FormDump</I> - Form Decoder and Dumper
<HR>

<p>
This sample is a Microsoft Internet Server extension, similar to CGI
extensions common to many internet servers.  FORMDUMP illustrates how
to write a DLL that can be used to obtain form data from a web
browser, and also how to build a reply to the form.
<p>
FORMDUMP first appeared in the first release of the Internet SDK.  This
version adds two useful features--output of the user account and a dump
of all server variables.
<p>
FORMDUMP's HttpExtensionProc does the following:
<P>
<OL><LI>Sends the header of the HTML response
<LI>Parses inbound form fields and send them back as HTML
<LI>Determines the security context in which the thread is running,
    and return the domain and user as HTML
<LI>Uses GetServerVariable to retrieve all server variables, and
    send them back as HTML
<LI>Sends the footer of the HTML resoponse
<LI>Returns control to IIS
</OL>
<p>
Along with the basic HTML output functions found in the original
version of FORMDUMP, this version adds HtmlPrintf(). See html.h
and html.cpp for details.
<p>
To build this sample, you must have the Internet SDK installed, 
and the environment of your compiler properly set.  A Visual C++ 
4.0 makefile is also included for your convenience.  See readme.txt for
additonal build issues.
<p>
Here is an example of how this utility works. The following is
a form used by the ISrvMon sample. If you submit this form to
FormDump.Dll instead, it shows you the values that the various
form parameters were decoded to.
<p>
You can use FormDump.Dll with any form.  It is useful in understanding
how data comes in from the web browser.
