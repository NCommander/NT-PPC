<HR>

<P>
AuthFilt demonstrates how to write an authentication filter based on an external
datasource.  Authentication is the process of accepting or denying a request from a client,
so AuthFilt will be notified each time an authentication request comes in.  This sample uses a
file (c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt) to keep track of authorized users, but you
might modify this sample to access a database which holds user info.
<P>
For each authentication request, AuthFilt first looks in a cache of recently
authenticated users, and when that fails, AuthFilt looks in the userdb.txt file.
This shows an efficient way to authorize connections: a cache allows the
filter to quickly authenticate users, and because each request comes in through the
filter, speed is critical.

Steps to build the sample:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the environment variables WWWROOT and WWWSCRIPTS to
point to your c:\inetsrv\wwwroot and c:\inetsrv\scripts directory, respectively.</LI>

<LI>Make sure your INCLUDE variable points to both the Win32 SDK and the ISAPI
header files, and make sure your LIB variable points to the Win32 SDK.</LI>

<LI>With your PATH variable set to your compiler, run nmake from the command line inside
the AuthFilt directory.</LI>

<LI>Run REGEDIT.EXE and modify the server's registry as follows.  Choose HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
CurrentControlSet, Services, W3SVC, Parameters, then Filter DLLs.  Select the Edit menu, 
then String.  This will bring up a dialog to modify the value of the key.  Append 
a comma (,) and a local path to AuthFilt.Dll, usually
C:\INetSrv\Scripts\SDK\AuthFilt.Dll.</LI>

<LI>Restart the WWW service.</LI>
</OL>

The build results will be copied to your WWW structure: AuthFilt.Dll will be copied to
the SDK sub-directory off the path specified in WWWSCRIPTS, and Default.Htm will be 
copied to the AuthFilt sub-directory off the path specified in WWWROOT.  The registry
entry Filter DLLs is used by IIS to determine what filters to load when the WWW 
service is starting.<P>
