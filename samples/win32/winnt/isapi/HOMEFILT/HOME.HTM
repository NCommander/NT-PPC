<I>HomeFilt - A Filter for Dynamic URL Redirection</I>
<HR>

<P>
If your URL contains only a slash for the site (i.e. http://yoursite/), then you've
been redirected by HomeFilt.  This ISAPI DLL redirects requests for the site's root
to another URL, http://yoursite/SDK/Home.Htm.  And Home.Htm is what you are
reading now.
<P>
See <A HREF="/SDK/HomeFilt.Htm">HomeFilt.Htm</A> for the sample details.
