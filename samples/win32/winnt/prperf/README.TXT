AppleTalk PAP Protocol Sample


The PRPERF sample is a Windows Socket application that demonstrates how to 
use the AppleTalk PAP Protocol. Both a server and a client application are 
included in the source for this sample. The client application reads a file 
and sends the contents to the server application. The server writes the 
bytes received to another file.
